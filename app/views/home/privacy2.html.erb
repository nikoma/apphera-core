						<p><strong>Welcome to Envato’s Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Hi there, we’re Envato Pty Ltd (ABN 11 119 159 741) of Level 1, 121 King Street Melbourne, 3000, Australia (“<strong>Envato</strong>”) and welcome to our privacy policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Envato user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across Envato Elements, Envato Market, Envato Studio, Envato Sites, Envato Hosted and Envato Tuts+ (the “<strong>Sites</strong>”).</li>
<li>When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Envato’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</li>
<li>If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>If you’re a user or visitor in the European Economic Area these rights also apply to you:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>For the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”), we are a ‘data controller’ of your personal information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How you can access your personal information</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You are also entitled to ask us to port your personal information (i.e. to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights to object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more fully described below.</li>
<li>These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent.</li>
<li>Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us.

<li>If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities.
