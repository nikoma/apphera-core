line-height:115%'>How We Collect and Use Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Information you provide us directly:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We ask for certain information such as your username, real
name, birthdate, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for
<span class=GramE>a</span> <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> account, or if
you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the <span
class=GramE>Service, and</span> may collect information you provide in User
Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain,
and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your username
and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly.
Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Information we may receive from third parties:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may receive information about you from third parties. For
example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection
or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,”
adding the <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> application, linking your account
to the <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> Service, etc., that third party may
pass certain information about your use of its service to <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>.
This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated
with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary
to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party
to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with
that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user
IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your
experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our
Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join <span
class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>. You should always review, and if necessary,
adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before
linking or connecting them to the <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> Service.
You may also unlink your <span class=GramE>third party</span> account from the
Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Inviting a friend to use <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> may, in its sole
discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the
Service. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to
the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a
friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do
not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not
retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by
inviting a friend to <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> through the “Invite
friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal
accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you
understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent
from <span class=SpellE>you</span> phone. Since this invitation is coming
directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this
communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Finding your friends on the Service:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> may, in its sole
discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with <span
class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> accounts through a “Find friends” feature. The
“Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as
Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on <span
class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>. If you choose to find your friends through your
contact list, then you agree to provide <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>
access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to
determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is
using <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>. If you choose to find your friends
through social media sites, then you understand that the information these
sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their
privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to
find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a
name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. Note
that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or
information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such
information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on <span
class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Analytics information:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party
analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for
the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile
device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in
improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in
aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any
particular individual user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy. When you
visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file
containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely
identifies your browser and lets <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> help you
log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also
convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you
view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service<span
class=GramE>), and</span> allow us or our business partners to track your usage
of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after
you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears
after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
disabled. Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Log file information:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Log file information is automatically reported by your
browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our
Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These
server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request,
Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,
number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,
landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Clear gifs/web beacons information:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also
known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage
patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based
emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are
clicked by recipients. The information is <span class=GramE>allows</span> for
more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Device identifiers:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device
(including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect,
monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a
universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files
or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device,
which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with
the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by <span
class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>. A device identifier may convey information to us
about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain
persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your
navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function
properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Location data:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device,
we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which
may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar
information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may
convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some
features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function
properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Commercial and marketing communications:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use the information we collect or receive, such as your
email address, to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails
containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to
receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change
your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related
emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and
reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security
notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails. You may also be able
to be “found” on <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> based on information that
you provide (see “Find friends on <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>”) above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> will disclose your

believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the
reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to

we collect about you:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may share certain service type information, including
information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device
identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data,
referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) with our third-party business partners for the purposes

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Ads on <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may also share certain information such as your location,
browser, and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service
with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of
interest to you. <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> may allow third-party ad
servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These
third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your
browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the <span
class=GramE>Service, and</span> will automatically receive your IP address when
they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript,
device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile
information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the
Service and on other websites, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads
and to personalize the advertising content delivered to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, Google uses DART cookies in order to deliver
ads to you through the Service. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and
its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Service and
previous websites that you may have visited. Other advertising networks also
use similar cookies, clear gifs, or other mechanisms to deliver targeted
advertising to you through the Service. You can delete these cookies by
following the instructions here: <span class=GramE>http://www.EQBotics.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cookies
.</span> You may opt out of use of Google’s DART cookie and cookies placed by
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) certified ad networks here: <span
class=GramE>http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .</span>
Opting out of these cookies will be effective not only on the Service, but on
all websites with NAI certified advertising networks. However, these opt-outs
will be ineffective on networks that are not NAI certified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please note that an advertiser may ask <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>
to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or
other interests). In that situation, <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span> or our
Partners determines the target audience and <span class=SpellE>EQBotics</span>
serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous data to the
advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may
conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
